Code Cleanups:
--- 	Fix redundant usage of testing.fail where log.errorf is sufficient
	I've noticed any output in stderr is sufficient to make a test failure (I'm not sure yet)
	Take advantage of testing.expect procedures as well
--	Comment codes and try out the odin doc
--	Cleanup any redundant commented codes
---	Organize tests, put all the reusable types and procedures in one file, mark the others private to their files
